<br>

Fish in the sea \
You know how I feel \
River running free \
You know how I feel \
Blossom in the trees \
You know how I feel

Muse, Feeling Good

<br><br>

I turn the music up, I got my records on \
I shut the world outside until the lights come on \
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone \
I feel my heart start beatin' to my favorite song

Coldplay, Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall

<br><br>


Cold and frosty morning, there's not a lot to say \
About the things caught in my mind \
And as the day was dawning, my plane flew away \
With all the things caught in my mind

Oasis, Donâ€™t Go Away

<br><br>

Standing in line to see the show tonight \
And there's a light on, heavy glow \
By the way, I tried to say \
I'd be there, waiting for

Red Hot Chili Peppers, By The Way

<br><br>

I'd walk a million miles, just to see you smile \
I need you by my side, we get high on life

Martin Garrix
